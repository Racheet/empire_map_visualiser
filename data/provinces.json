        "description": "This formerly peaceful stretch of the Couros river was also home to pleasure gardens, parks and country estates. Reikos is composed of sweeping plains with occasional patches of decidious woodland or raised elevation. The only major woodlands outside of the Great Forest of Peytaht is Broken Ride, while only the south-eastern downs around Chalcis Mount really count as being hills.\n\nThe wealth of Reikos traditionally came from four places. Firstly, the Vigilant Swan and the Great Forest at Reikos produced quality stone and wood respectively, as well as highly sought after white granite and weirwood. Second, the Gardens of Chalcis produced herbs sold all over the Empire. Third, the wide roads helped connect the Navarr in Therunin and the Urizen in Morrow with the rest of the Empire and several towns grew up to cater to the needs of merchants and pilgrims. Fourth, the beauty of Reikos itself made the territory wealthy - the great gardens, sweeping estates and peaceful surroundings made it a favourite place for Imperial citizens from across the Empire to convalesce after illness, or to spend time away for the cares of everyday life.\n\nThe downfall of Reikos came from it's border with the Great Forest of Peytaht. At its edges, the Great Forest is an abundant source of lumber but, it's heart is wild and untamed. The long border with the dark forest was notoriously hard to defend, despite the efforts of vigilant chapters such as the the Grey Watchers of Peytaht, but at least the forest was equally hostile to human and orc alike. When the Druj barbarians launched a surprise attack through the forest in 367YE, the Highborn were woefully unprepared for it. Those chapters on the edge of the forest that did not retreat were overwhelmed in the first few months of the attack.\n\nRecovering Reikos is an important goal for many Highborn chapters. Several, such as the (now-Bastion based) Shattered Tower; the Unbound Chapter (now in exile in Casinea), the Cantiarch's Hold, Stone Vigil, Reumah's Reoubt or the Lux Reikos have their foundations here, while others such as The Unrelenting have formed specifically to ensure that Reikos is recovered. They will not rest until the Druj are driven out, Reikos is restored, the gardens re-planted, and the bells set up on high so that the sacrifice of the defenders of Highguard will never be forgotten.",

The tribe, whose name is now lost to antiquity, were exterminated during the war of conquest, finally forced back to their stronghold in Ulvenholme and destroyed after a terrible siege.\n\nIt was from Semmerholm that the Dawnish planned their campaign against the burghers of pre-League Holberg, who engaged in a variety of innovative and underhand strategies to keep the Imperial forces off-balance as well as launching regular attacks into Dawnish territory. In the centuries since, relations between the people of Holberg and those of Semmerholm have mellowed extensively - prior to the invasion of the Druj a great deal of trade passed through the great stone Gate set into the southwestern peaks.\n\nSemmerholm produces a major share of the nation's food, for all that it is closely surrounded by thick and dangerous forests. The dark woodlands are home to vicious beasts, including boars, lions and bears as well as several species of drake and a few rare dire beasts. Hunting is a regular pastime for nobles and yeomen alike, and helps encourage a perception of the people of Semmerholm as being a little \"wilder\" than the average Dawnishfolk.\n\nThere are several well-built castles here at various strategic points along the border, protecting Semmerholm from the barbarians of the The Barrens and Holberg. The people for Semmerholm have long felt responsible for holding the borders against the savage tide and this responsibility tends to weigh particularly heavily on the head of the Semmerholm senator.

Citizens of Temeschwar commonly make an effort to be as flamboyant as their southern fellows, but their dress is inevitably more practical, to accommodate the harsh northern weather. They are tradtionally more brutally pragmatic than those who live on the bay. It is a foothold of trade to Varushka, Wintermark and nearby Dawn. Trading in raw materials and crafted goods, especially weapons and armour, it is seen by many as the merchant capital of the northern lands.\n\nDespite its good relations with Varushka, Temeschwar has always suffered somewhat from being distant from Sarvos and Tassato whose close proximity made them the natural heart of the League. Temeschwar may well be the richest of all the cities of the League, but it can never quite shake the fear that it is not as good as the others. This anxiety is just part of what drives the Temeschwari to be so competitive and so ruthless. Temeschwari strive to work that bit longer and that bit harder than anyone else in the League. If a Sarvossian closes their shop at sunset, their Temeschwari neighbour will light a pair of lanterns and keep trading for another hour.\n\nNot all relations with Varushka are good, however. There is still some bad blood between those of old Varushkan stock in Temeschwar and the citizens of Karov#Delev Delev in Karov. When Temeschwar joined the Empire it attempted to prove that it had legitimate ownership of the Eternal Shafts of Time, a rich mithril mine on the border between the two territories. There are still plays and theatrical adaptations that revolve around the underhand, ruthless way the boyar of Delev \"stole\" the mine from under the noses of the Temeschwari, and relations between some Delev traders and and some citizens of Temeschwar are chilly to this day - especially in the rare cases where there is some distant blood connection between the two.\n\nThe Temeschwari are not just the most competitive people in the League, they also have a well deserved reputation as the most ruthless. In the years before the creation of the Empire, the city was plagued by gangs of thieves and assassins who operated with open impunity despite the best efforts of the boyar, Ratibor. Thousands of inhabitants were linked with the different gangs who used tattoos to mark membership and enforce loyalty.\n\nIn the end Ratibor hired a force of Varushkan mercenaries and brought them in secret into the city during the depths of winter. In the notorious night of a thousand torches (named for the torches the soldiers carried to light their way) every inhabitant of the city was turned out of their beds, stripped and searched for marks. Anyone with a tattoo on their body was given a few minutes to collect their belongings before being forced from the city into the frozen snows beyond the walls. A few managed to bribe their way past the search but most were given over to the winter and were never seen again. The act was one of monstrous brutality, but it established the power of Ratibor as boyar and broke the power of the criminal gangs forever.\n\nThe Temeschwari wear their reputation for cold, hard dealing with pride. They view themselves as the strongest people in the League, combining the ambition and drive of the south with the strength and determination of the north. Physical as well as mental strength is prized here - Temeschwari bravos are as likely to favour the axe as the rapier - and her free companies have a reputation for toughness, as soldiers and as people. Most Temeschwari free companies are careful not to break the rules for they know the magistrates watch them carefully - but they will do almost anything required to win short of this. You can find many things in Temeschwar, it is said, but you will not find a scruple though you search the city from sunrise to sunset.",

It's one of the few areas where anything other than beer is drunk - a drink made of the sap of the birch trees that warms their hearts in the cold winter nights but brings strange dreams. The people who live up here have closer links to the Navarr than many in the Marches, and more need for Beaters than most.\n\nThrough the dark heart of those woods are paths no Marcher treads.

The vales here exist among rich forests, where they have not been cleared to make way for small farms. Karov has the largest towns in Varushka, and the majority of its boyars come from this relatively civilised territory. A great deal of trade happens in Karov, with wagon trains and river barges carrying raw materials south to Temeschwar or Weirwater and north to more isolated valleys who are in need.\n\nDespite its settled nature, it would be a mistake to think the land is entirely tamed and great tracts of wilderness still remain, often home to particularly malignant ‚Äì if quiescent ‚Äì sovereigns. These creatures awaken or emerge from time to time with often tragic consequences - so the wise ones take care to ensure each generation remembers the warning stories about creatures whose last depredations may have been in the times of their grandparents or great-grandparents.\n\nKarov was one of the first places settled by the Vard during their early conflict with the Ushka. They ruthlessly cleared areas of forests to build their settlements and some of the oldest towns show clear influence of their shared heritage with the Steinr of Wintermark, especially in the west. Indeed, there are several old battlefields in western Karov where Vard and Stienr, and later Varushkan and Wintermark, clashed in the distant past long before the foundation of the Empire. A number of very old tales from Karov include two siblings who romance a stranger; the former represent Vard and Steinr, the latter the Ushka. Invariably the elder sibling wins the affection of the stranger, and the younger angrily retreats to the west. This is a highly stylised and historically dubious version of the founding of Varushka, but it is popular nonetheless.\n\nOn the whole, the folk of Karov enjoy many of the finer things in life - good food, good drink and regular festivals. Many towns and villages in Karov employ Stzena, local musicians who perform at local civic events and celebrations; there are several vales here dedicated specifically to the training of Stzena, and recording and preserving the music and songs of the Varushkan people.",

There's precious little in the way of vegetation, only scrub that clings to the slopes. However, there are riches in the mountains; here the Freeborn find precious bametals and minerals, often as sediment lying in the streambeds. Scattered settlements shelter in the valleys, with the remains of stone fortresses and watchtowers decaying on the heights above, remnants from the days before Empire when the Freeborn warred with the Marches.\n\nTo the south of the mountains of Kahraman lie sweeping grass plains, a seemingly desolate landscape dotted with strange rock formations shaped by the wind. Here the Freeborn graze the bulk of their herds of goats and sheep. The wind from the west, the Del√©s, is constant and bitingly cold at night. As a result, for shelter, Freeborn communities settle in bowl-shaped depressions cut from the earth, their tents sunk below the plains surface.\n\nThe families of Kahraman have a somewhat undeserved reputation for being quarrelsome; as a response, the Freeborn established the post of Dhomiro of the Cinnabar Hills to help mediate their disputes and to encourage trade between the sometimes quite isolated settlements here. The Dhomiro is an Imperial title that is appointed each Autumn by Freeborn citizens who control fleet personal resources.",

It takes its common epithet from the many mirrors found upon the roofs of the city, said to \"sparkle like gems\" during the day. Folk legend suggests that if the mirrors are shattered the city will surely fall, and for this reason some citizens carry a mirror about their person, an affectation that encourages unfair accusations of vanity.\n\nSarvos is as driven as any city in the League, but art is its true passion. They claim to have invented theatre, a ludicrous claim but believable in a city graced with so many theatre-houses. They are certainly the originators of the magician troupes that are now commonplace throughout the League and they are usually the centre of League performance magic. Not just theatre is popular however; there are rival opera houses whose bitter divisions are every bit as keen as those of the leading theatre troupes. Several wealthy merchant princes have endowed their collections of art on the city and there are public galleries where the most beautiful pictures and sculptures can be viewed in exchange for a ring or two.\n\nThe land around the Bay of Catazar is lush and fertile, with low flood-plains; olive farms and prime grazing lands fed by the waters of four rivers: the lazy Couros that flows along the border of Highguard and Urizen; the flighty Scorrero, whose capricious nature has drowned many an unwary river captain on its course through the Brass Coast; the broad-banked Gancio, solid and well-defended; and the furious Vassa that flows down through Tassato. The four rivers are central characters in the art and folklore of the city. All the classic literature and theatre includes them in one form or another, whether as central characters or ‚Äúclowns‚Äù during the interludes. A popular game between playwrights and critics is to conceal the characters in some way and challenge the critic to locate them.\n\nArt in all forms is held in high regard, Sarvos is famous for its architecture, but it is also a byword for excellent food, and every bar, street vendor and hostelry prides itself on providing its own speciality snack: perhaps a particular way of spicing ham, or salting and smoking beef, or an excellent dipping sauce for vegetables. It is said that an epicure can dine out every night of their life in Sarvos and never eat the same meal twice.\n\nCramped streets flow between soaring towers, choked with merchants, tradesmen and students. It is the site of Diora University, a prominent seat of learning that specialises in researching obscure topics for money. Here can also be found Capodomus Cathedral, one of the largest religious structures in the Empire, a towering monument encrusted with precious materials and objets d‚Äôart.\n\nOn the south side of Sarvos are the drowned streets of Caricomare ‚Äì a shattered ruin, waist-deep in water at its highest points and submerged entirely in others. Thirty years ago, it was a prosperous suburb of Sarvos. One night, however, a great storm came out of nowhere and the river burst its banks. The route of the river changed overnight and a mighty wave washed away the foundations of many buildings. In a single night, Carciomare was ruined ‚Äì buildings were toppled and the streets filled with saltwater. The repairs were considered too costly and the floods created a displaced populace, compounding the overcrowding in the city. Caricomare today is an abandoned, dangerous place, a maze of flooded streets and waterlogged buildings, but it is said that riches can still be found in the depths, for those brave enough to investigate.",

The marsh serves as the national graveyard and this is a place of ancient secrets and mysticism. The stories of the mystics say that in ancient times a flight of crows flew over the marshes scattering feathers into the waters below. Where each feather landed, a Kallavesi emerged from the marshes.\n\nIt is a mournful land, but a beautiful one. Thanes' halls are traditionally constructed entirely from wood here and those built in marshy areas are raised up on stilts. Many halls in Kallavesa are built around sacred places or places with a magical reputation. There are not believed to be any troll ruins in Kallavesa; while stories occasionally speak of shattered halls buried beneath the Rhundal Marsh, these tales are considered largely fanciful or allegorical.\n\nParts of Kallavesa, especially the West Marsh have a reputation for being haunted. Not only are the marshes where the honoured dead of Wintermark are interred, they have also seen regular battles through the ages. Several vicious battlefields lie drowned beneath the boggy marshes; the Jotun have raided across the narrow sea from Kallsea since time-out-of-mind; in pre-Imperial centuries there were irregular border skirmishes across the southern borders - first with with the the orcs who dwelt where Bregasland and Mitwold lie today, later with Marchers who displaced them. Orc and human dead alike lie in the deep pools of the western and southern marshes, and they do not always lie still.\n\nKallavesa is rich to many fine herb gardens. Perhaps as a consequence of the many battlefields buried beneath the marshes, the territory is known for the quality of the bladeroot that grows here. The Kallavesi themselves are acknowledged experts in the use of herbs - the Infusions of Feathers were first developed here in the Wittal Groves and later shared with apothecaries from across the Empire.\n\nThe Senator for Kallavesa is appointed by the Kallavesi during the Winter Solstice, and is almost invariably of Kallavesi stock.",

Unsurprisingly, there are many citadels here and a strong martial tradition, but this is also a territory that produces more than its fair share of zoologists and botanists. These natural philosophers are sometimes blamed for the more esoteric animals and plants found here, and the occasional mutated hybrid horror that appears here is often a sign that a magician is straying dangerously close to insanity. This territory is regularly troubled by the attentions of small packs of trogoni.",

The main thrust of pre-Imperial Urizen settlement was in Morrow to the north, and the two territories were connected by a tenuous \"bridge\" of spires stretching across Zenith. Even then, the place had a haunted reputation. At some point in the distant past, powerful magic was worked here and the echoes of that magic occasionally caused trouble for the Urizen in their mountain fastnesses.\n\nAt the heart of the territory is the Black Plateau, great plateau of volcanic glass with a dire reputation. Artefacts from the Black Plateau are often considered haunted or touched by malign evil, and are generally destroyed when they are encountered.",

        "description": "Sermersuaq is the ancestral home of the Suaq people. The forests and tundra of this territory are rich with animal life that sustains the Winterfolk, ranging from great furred beasts to small game and hunting birds. The northern waters are home to seals and penguins, and full of fish and whales. As one travels further north, the land becomes colder and colder until a traveller comes to transient ice floes that mark the the farthest extent of the land claimed by the Winterfolk. This fertile territory is under constant threat from both the Thule and the Jotun whose hunting parties also seek to exploit the profusion of life here, regularly engaging in skirmishes with the Winterfolk who live here.\n\nSermersuaq is notable for the interconnected freshwater lakes of Lansipari, Ittanpari, Atkonaroq, Sarda, Rikkivesi and the Eastern Floes. Deep and frigid, often dotted with chunks of floating ice in the coldest winters, perhaps half the area of Sermersuaq is made up of these frigid \"inland seas.\" these massive waterways teem with fish and are said to be connected to each other by flooded underground passages and the lakes on Kallavesa and Hahnmark. Old stories speak of the lakes being \"carved by mountains\" in some fashion. There are many halls built along the shores of the lake who prosper through fishing and occasionally trading across the cool waters.\n\nThe territory takes its name from the legendary figure of Sermersuaq. Sermersuaq was said to be so powerful that she could balance a kayak on the tips of three fingers, and kill a seal just by rapping it on the head with her knuckles. According to legend, Sermersuaq rode out heavily pregnant from Sydanjaa on a mammoth. She gave birth to one thousand children, half of whom drowned themselves and returned as seals to provide food for the others. Some say Sermersuaq was an Eternal and that all the Suaq share a trace of her bloodline, others argue she is an allegory for the enduring and tenacious spirit of the Winterfolk.\n\nBeyond the ice floes is the wasteland of Tsirku, where the ground is permanently covered in snow. The landscape is far from flat, there are ice plateaus pock-marked with crevasses and areas where the ice is rent apart giving way to cold salty lakes. Here rages the eternal ice-storm Sydanjaa, a roaring blizzard that blows all year round and from whose depths no traveller has ever returned.\n\nThe Senator for Sermersuaq is appointed by the Suaq during the Summer solstice, and is almost invariably from Suaq stock.",

        "description": "Peering at each other across the fast-flowing Vassa, Tassato is called the Twin City or the Split City. Providing the only easy way to cross the wide and dangerous river, Tassato is a city divided against itself. Tassato was originally two towns, Mestra and Regario, named for the feuding siblings who historically founded them on either bank of the Vassa. Over time, both towns grew on each bank and the river formed a natural boundary between them. Attempts to build bridges between the cities have always foundered and the people rely on boats and barges to cross the river.\n\nThe western part of the city is called Tassato Mestra, and the eastern is Tassato Regario. The people on either side of the river are historically rivals, and that historical rivallry occasionally boils up into open conflict. The two cities were unified under the control of Anabela di Regario, a merchant prince who ruled over a century before the creation of the Empire. Anabela was forced to contend with the constant rivalry between the two cities, open battles in the streets between bravos was causing widespread lawlessness and in the end the prince declared a ban on the open carrying of weapons. The ban had the desired effect, damping down the bloodshed although and the rivalry was slowly transformed to verbal banter between the two sides. The ban endured until Tassato joined the Empire and in that time the people became famous for their wordplay, launching quips and insults at each other like arrows.\n\nToday Tassato enjoys an unrivalled reputation as a city where the spoken word is an art-form. Tassatans take a delight in layered meanings, subtexts and unspoken communication. The city has provided several senators famous for their brilliant oratory and representatives from the city are usually regarded as the finest diplomats in the Empire. Of all the people of the League, Tassatans are most likely to view life as a game and they are notorious for their love of intrigue, not just for the sake of advancement but for the sheer pleasure to be had thereby. They regard cunning diplomacy more highly than armed conflict, not because they are peace-loving, but instead because they regard words as a more effective tool than weapons in destroying their enemies - better to set enemies against enemies than to face them yourself. Manipulation is high art here - no surprise that the first and the finest mountebanks hail from Tassato.\n\nTassato Mestra is famous both for its boatyards - it is the primary source of the riverboats that ply their trade from Sarvos deep into Dawn - and for the boldness of its brothels. The west bank of the river is almost entirely given over to a gaudy display of brazenness, the so-called Street of Pleasures where anyone with the purse for it can buy company, narcotics and other goods of dubious virtue. The east part of the city, Tassato Regario, is best known for its workshops and magicians. According to legend, the printing press was designed in Tassato Regario and the first presses were employed here printing religious tracts, scholarly treatises and political manifestos.\n\nIn the centre of the Vassa towers the Imperial Mint where Imperial coinage is produced. While the fortified building itself is operated by the civil service, its protection falls to the people of the League, and the Master of the Imperial Mint is an important title among its citizens.\n\nCitizens of Tassato generally refer to Regario and Mestra as seperate places, while everyone else refers to them as wards or parts of the same city.",

Founded by Gilda Heimssdottir, it stands over the entrance to a frozen underworld cavern into the walls of which are carvings in a mysterious alphabet that are said to be the source of the magical runes used throughout Wintermark.\n\nThe folk of Skarsind were particularly noted for their fine rune work and many of the best artisans and runesmiths traveled here to study their craft. There were troubles with tribes of yetis that live in the valleys above Skarsind, but most of the danger here came from the Thule barbarians living on the far side of the mountains in Otkodov.\n\nSkarsind has always been riven by conflict; a saga called Lament for Skarsind is popular in some parts of Wintermark.",

Large open buildings, with doorways and halls just larger than a human might need, they create a sense of open space that has set the pattern for all Urizen architecture.\n\nDespite its great age Morrow moves inexorably forward, and many of its spires are undergoing constant reconstruction and improvement. It is said that ‚Äúno two days find the same Morrow‚Äù as the Urizen constantly strive to perfect their land even further.

It was in Miekarova that the Imperial Faith found its deepest roots in Varushka, and there are a number of vales here that surround churches and shrines to the Way.

Dawnish senators were incandescent with fury but there was nothing they could do and Holberg became the prosperous fourth city of the League.\n\nIn the decades that followed Holberg grew rich and prosperous.
